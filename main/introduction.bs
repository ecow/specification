=====================

Issue: Write Introduction section.

Issue: Explain the principle of orthogonality,
  by which this spec is split into multiple documents.

Issue: Explain that this specification is not documentation;
  it is the easiest way to understand how Solid works,
  not the easiest way for building a Solid app.
